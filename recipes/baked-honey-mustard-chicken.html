    <h4>Directions</h4>

      <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.</li>
      <li>Season chicken breasts with salt and pepper. Place in the prepared baking dish.</li>
      <li>Combine honey, mustard, basil, paprika, and parsley in a small bowl; mix well. Pour 1/2 of the honey mustard mixture over chicken and brush to cover.</li>
